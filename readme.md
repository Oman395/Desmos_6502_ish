# why are you here
This is just a silly side project I made, and really isn't intended to be used by anyone else. With that being said, I'm still hosting the code, because why not :3
If you somehow aren't here from a Desmos community, or just need the link again, [here is the graph.](https://www.desmos.com/geometry/u5c372ifk5)

Usage:
Literally just do node index.js [filename], then copy the output into the "r\_om" variable on the Desmos page.

Warning: This has literally zero error checking besides making sure you specified a valid file. If you make a typo, _this will not catch it_. The only way to catch mistypes is by seeing the undefined in the output.
